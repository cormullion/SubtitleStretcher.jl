1
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:05,999
I thought you'd never get back.

2
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,481
There was a heck of a crowd on the piste.

3
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,723
So I see.

4
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:14,886
- Mission accomplished?
- Best beluga.

5
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:20,050
Vodka - rather shaken -
and one microchip.

6
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,373
Good. I'll make a signal to M.

7
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:32,100
Be a good girl, would you,
and put her on automatic.

8
00:05:35,623 --> 00:05:39,306
And we could do with a couple of glasses.

9
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:42,629
They're in the overhead rack.

10
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,113
Commander Bond...!

11
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:51,476
Call me James. It's five days to Alaska.

12
00:09:29,492 --> 00:09:33,615
- Thank goodness you're here, James.
- That's very nice, Moneypenny.

13
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:35,617
A little over the top for the office?

14
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:39,500
I've been trying to reach you all morning.
What have you been up to?
